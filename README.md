# Horiseon Marketing Website
## Description
The goal of this project was to improve the codebase for a client website in order to:
-  Follow accessibility standards 
-  Increase Long-term sustainability 
-  Optimise search engines

I learnt how to apply accessibility standards to the HTML & CSS code and to optimise the search engine with an effective title.
